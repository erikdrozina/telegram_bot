# Telegram_bot

#### Just a bot I did in my free time  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Packages:
To install required packages run:

    pip3 install python-telegram-bot pyyaml

## Token:
To generate the token you have to talk to [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) on Telegram.

## Usage:
Open a terminal and type:

    git clone https://github.com/erikdrozina/telegram_bot ~/path/
    cd ~/path/

Create a file called "token.yaml" and paste the bot token in it

Run the python code:

    python3 main.py

Enjoy :)
